Description: The STS model consists of autoregression, which accounts for the influence of previous data points on current observations, moving averages, which easeâ€¯out short-term fluctuations in the data
local linear trends - which obtain localized linear trends within the time series.
seasonality - which identifies recurring patterns linked to specific time-related factors and regression, which allows the incorporation of external variables that may affect the time series.
